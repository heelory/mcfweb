                <p>
                    God has a plan for you that is far bigger and weightier than the 
                    best of your plans for yourself. The New Birth positions you to 
                    begin the journey to the realisation of this ultimate desire of God 
                    for your life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the beginning of an adventure worthy of an entire lifetime. 
                    Interestingly, it does not cost anything to be born again. It is not a 
                    privilege available to a class of people; it is a provision that is   
                    available for all. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whatever you might have indulged yourself in does not matter  
                    because Jesus bore your sins on his body on the cross and 
                    purchased your soul by the same sacrifice. All you have to do is 
                    believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and confess His Lordship over your  
                    life.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="txting2">
                <p>
                    This is in accordance with the scriptures which says, ‘that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation’ (Rom. 10:9-10).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can just bow your head now and utter these words from your heart: ‘Lord Jesus, I believe you died for my sins and were raised for my justification. I confess today that you are my Lord. Guide my feet henceforth to the realisation and fulfilment of that for which you died. Thank you, my Lord and Saviour! Amen.’
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you said those words from your heart, you are welcome to God’s family. Now, the adventure of aligning with and following God’s plan to the end can begin.
